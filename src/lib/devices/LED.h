 * @brief  Macros for controlling a single LED connected with its anode to 
 * an output pin via a current limiting resistor, and with its cathode 
 * connected to ground. This gives active-low logic.
 * 
 * Default configuration is suitable for 'Arduino Pro Mini' board with 
 * LED on port B, pin 5.
 *
 * To override the default config, define LED_DEFS prior then
 * defined the LED_XXX definitions as required.
